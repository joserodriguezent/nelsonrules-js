# Nelson Rules - JavaScript

## The rules

These are taken from Wikipedia

### Nelson Rule 01

 * One point is more than 3 standard deviations from the mean.
 * At least one sample is grossly out of control.

### Nelson Rule 02

 * Nine (or more) points in a row are on the same side of the mean.
 * Some prolonged bias exists

### Nelson Rule 03

 * Six (or more) points in a row are continually increasing (or decreasing).
 * A trend exists.

### Nelson Rule 04

 * Fourteen (or more) points in a row alternate in direction, increasing then decreasing.
 * This much oscillation is beyond noise.

### Nelson Rule 05

 * Two (or three) out of three points in a row are more than 2 standard deviations from the mean in the same direction.
 * There is a medium tendency for samples to be mediumly out of control.

### Nelson Rule 06

 * Four (or five) out of five points in a row are more than 1 standard deviation from the mean in the same direction.
 * There is a strong tendency for samples to be slightly out of control.

### Nelson Rule 07

 * Fifteen points in a row are all within 1 standard deviation of the mean on either side of the mean.
 * With 1 standard deviation, greater variation would be expected.

### Nelson Rule 07

 * Eight points in a row exist, but none within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and the points are in both directions from the mean.
 * Jumping from above to below whilst missing the first standard deviation band is rarely random.

### Nelson Rule 08

 * Eight points in a row exist, but none within 1 standard deviation of the mean, and the points are in both directions from the mean.
 * Jumping from above to below whilst missing the first standard deviation band is rarely random.
